## Project Details

During this pandemic, the global warmth has been neglected. During only 2020, the Amazonian rainforest and the Australian continent suffered from severe wildfires. We will aproach the dataset [1.88 Million US Wildfires](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) by Racheal Tatman.

As an Exploratory Data Analysis point of view, we will look at the zones affected, which include states or regions, time of day/year and the seasons, as well as the seasons of wildfires and the intensity, duration and acres covered by the fire.

We will train models to predict the time, zone, cause, intensity or surface covered to gain better insights about this phenomenom and learn more patterns to try and predict or contain the damages caused by wildfires
